[Chorus]
I want it
I need it
I want somebody
I want it
I need it
I want your eyes to turn
I need it
I want it
I want somebody
Baby
Now this is my turn

[Verse 1]
I don't want any more doors
Cause I'm walkin' on the string
They only slam any more
Like we're pulling our teeth
And I could just see your eyes
Just above your shoulder
And you were scannin' the skies for me
I dreamt like you were some long-forgotten soldier
Like I was someone that you cared for

[Pre-Chorus]
I want it
I need it

[Chorus]
I want it
I need it
I want somebody
I want it
I need it
I want your eyes to turn
I need it
I want it
I want somebody
Baby
Now this is my turn

[Verse 2]
I don't want any more heartbreak
I'm tired of the sound it makes
Like tryin' to shut out the dark at night
You close your eyes but it won't erase
And you were walkin' beside
Some other person's shadow
And it was more than I could take
I wouldn't see what I couldn't know
But there might be somebody after me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I want it
I need it

[Chorus]
I want it
I need it
I want somebody
I want it
I need it
I want your eyes to turn
I need it
I want it
I want somebody
Baby
Now this is my turn

[Verse 3]
I need that new vacation
Where nothing that's spoken is known
Let the winter be my station
I'll let the cold teach me what to know
That there might be somebody after me


I want it
I need it
I want it
I want it
I need it

[Chorus]
I want it
I need it
I want somebody
I want it
I need it
I want your eyes to turn
I need it
I want it
I want somebody
Baby
Now this is my turn
